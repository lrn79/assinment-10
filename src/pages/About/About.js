                        Surpassed outside client satisfaction average rates by eight percent within the first year.In the past, my primary hobby was photography, and I am excited to have made a career out of it. More recently, I have taken up daily runs to stay fit and enjoy volunteering my time with different homeless outreaches.I approach photography with a romantic, fine art sensibility. My imagery is understated yet evocative, resulting from clear and polished creative direction that elicits light-filled, painterly portraits. My use of fresh and simple composition, and natural light has evolved from a deep love and respect for the old masters - Rembrandt, Vermeer, Botticelli. I am a fiercely dedicated medium format film photographer and my creative process is imaginative, industrious and detailed. In each capture, I aim for perfection and beauty.

                        Over the last ten years, my work has taken me to spectacular celebrations and sophisticated soirees in over twenty countries on six different continents. Past clients have included prominent global leaders, celebrated directors and actors, and distinguished executives. I have been named one of the top 25 film photographers in the world and a “photographer’s photographer” by Martha Stewart Weddings. My work has been featured in numerous international publications, including Rangefinder, Elle, Harper’s Bazaar, Town & Country Weddings, Brides Magazine, The Knot, Martha Stewart Magazine, The Boston Globe and New York Magazine. My clients describe my work as “painterly,” “nuanced,” “refined” and I am honored to be a leading choice amongst internationally acclaimed planners and designers.

                        I also have an active role in educating photographers on the art and craft of shooting film. My written works include “The Master Guide to Fine Art Wedding Photography,” now in its third edition, “The Portraiture Reference Guides,” a 3 book series on natural and expressive portraiture and composition, and The Focused Guides, a series for advanced instruction and methodology. Upcoming conference appearances can be found on my press page.

                        I am a former New Yorker living in Southern California with my husband, two rambunctious little boys, and an elderly french bulldog named Gatsby. When I am not working, I can be found at the Santa Barbara House where we host Gatherings for Good: beautifully styled, al fresco dinners that feature the talents of our expansive and generous network, and benefit local non-profits that mean a lot to us. thats it,, If you read it <span className='text-success fw-bolder h1'>Thank you!</span> </h3>
